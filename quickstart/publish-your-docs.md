# Featured Systems

### Intelligent Client Intake Pipeline

Implementing AI classification can significantly streamline the client's intake process in law firms:

* **Classification:**
  * **Jurisdiction, Case Type, and Status:** AI effectively categorizes cases, ensuring efficient and accurate processing.
* **Dynamic Routing:**
  * Routes cases through case-type-specific question sets.
  * Ensures relevant information is gathered promptly and accurately.
*   **Document Generation:**

    * Fetch and populate necessary court documents based on context information.
    * Tailor documents to the firm's writing style and specific instructions.

    **Benefits**

    * **Efficiency and Accuracy:**
      * Saves time and enhances document consistency.
      * Improves client intake process effectiveness.
    *   **Operational Productivity:**

        * Reduces manual workload, allowing staff to focus on strategic tasks.
        * Facilitates faster case assessments and decision-making.

        **Long-Term Advantages**

        * **Resource Allocation:**
          * Better allocation of resources and adaptation to client needs.
        *   **Predictive Capabilities:**

            * AI tools improve operations over time, enhancing workflow optimization.

            By adopting these advanced technologies, law firms can maintain a competitive edge in delivering high-quality legal services, ensuring client interactions are more personalized and efficient.

### Case Management Interface

#### Limitations in Existing Solutions

Many existing legal case management solutions often lack flexibility and user-centric design, leading to inefficiencies and dissatisfaction.

* **Rigid Structures:** Many do not provide customizable options, forcing firms into one-size-fits-all workflows.
* **Complex Interfaces:** Overcomplicated systems can hinder productivity and user satisfaction.
* **Limited Storage Solutions:** Inefficient document management and storage options are prevalent.

#### Our Project's Advantages

1. **Feature Customization:**
   * Allows users to opt in or out of specific features, enhancing adaptability to unique workflows.
2. **Less is More:**
   * Minimalistic design patterns and a focus on simplicity/ease of use allow non-technologically inclined lawyers to get the most out of our tech.
3. **Minimizing Redundancy:**
   * Most lawyers / firms have an active subscription to either:
     * office application suites; ex. Microsoft Office or Google Workspace
     * cloud storage platforms; ex. Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive
   * Rather than hosting and upkeeping our own servers, we aim to leverage existing subscriptions for the benefits they provide at no extra cost to the user.
     * Our app implements a customizable 'documents' and 'calendar' UI, delivered with settings tailored to working with legal cases in the provided context.
     * Access to all functions of native apps (as permissible via API requests) and their pre-existing add-ons / integrations.
     * Prebuilt integrated custom actions for handling new cases; ex.  client submits intake form > triggers our new\_case\_from\_intake protocol > creates nested folder structure in external storage platform based on case details.
   * If the user does not have an active subscription, we will provide them with instructions on how to either:
     * self host their own document storage servers (free;  support planned for [paperless](https://docs.paperless-ngx.com/))
     * set up a subscription with mainstream platforms (paid; options are listed above)
